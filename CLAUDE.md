# CLAUDE.md — modelmatch-gitops

**Status: ACTIVE.** The GitOps repo for ModelMatch: the Helm umbrella + (later) ArgoCD app-of-apps that
deploy the cluster. Activated at **P9 (2026-06-14)** when the Helm umbrella was authored.

> Polyrepo: this is its **own git repo** — branches/commits/tags happen **here**, not in
> `modelmatch-infra`. See the umbrella `../CLAUDE.md` (working style, git strategy, stack) and
> `../docs/planning/01-devops-backlog.md` E12 rows for the slice plan.

## What this repo is

The **GitOps source of truth** for everything that runs *inside* the EKS cluster. Two layers:

1. **The ModelMatch product chart** — `charts/modelmatch/`, a Helm **umbrella** with **frontend** +
   **backend** local subcharts (Postgres subchart lands in **P13**). One release boundary for the app.
2. **ArgoCD app-of-apps** (from **P10**) — a root Application that points at this repo and fans out to
   platform child-apps (Nginx ingress, cert-manager, ESO, monitoring, logging) + the product chart.

**The deploy boundary:** CI (Jenkins, in `modelmatch-backend`/`-frontend`) builds images, pushes to ECR,
and **commits an image-tag bump here**; **ArgoCD** is the only thing that ever applies to the cluster.
Humans author chart structure; the CI Deploy stage edits image tags; ArgoCD syncs. **Never
`helm install` / `kubectl apply` app resources by hand** — that breaks the GitOps invariant.

## Chart layout

```
charts/modelmatch/                 # umbrella = the ModelMatch product chart (release boundary)
├── Chart.yaml                     # dependencies: backend, frontend (local, condition <name>.enabled)
├── values.yaml                    # global.imageRegistry + backend:/frontend: blocks
├── templates/NOTES.txt            # render summary (no workload templates at umbrella level)
└── charts/
    ├── backend/                   # FastAPI: Deployment+Service+ConfigMap, probes /healthz /readyz
    └── frontend/                  # nginx:   Deployment+Service+ConfigMap, probe /
```

- **Subcharts are real charts** (own `Chart.yaml`/`values.yaml`/`_helpers.tpl`), vendored under
  `charts/`. Helper `define` names are **namespaced** (`backend.*`, `frontend.*`) so they don't collide
  in one umbrella render.
- **Values flow:** umbrella `values.yaml` has a `backend:`/`frontend:` block per subchart + a shared
  `global:` block. Env-specific overrides layer on later as `values-<env>.yaml` **without restructuring**.
- **Image wiring:** `global.imageRegistry` (the ECR registry) + per-subchart `image.repository`/`image.tag`.
  The CI Deploy stage (P17/P18) bumps **one `tag` field** per repo.

## Hard rules (don't re-derive)

- **Resource requests/limits on EVERY container — no exceptions.** Backend: **request 256Mi/200m, limit
  1Gi/1CPU** — the 1Gi cap is the documented **ingestion-OOM gotcha** (the in-cluster Nova ingestion path
  must stay under it). Frontend (nginx): request 64Mi/50m, limit 128Mi/250m.
- **Probes:** backend liveness `/healthz` + readiness `/readyz` (FastAPI). Frontend liveness/readiness on
  `/`. Probe `port:` references the named container port (`http`), not a hardcoded number.
- **Container ports:** backend **8000** (gunicorn, non-root), frontend **8080** (nginx-unprivileged,
  uid 101). Services: backend `8000`, frontend `80` → targetPort `http`.
- **NO secrets in values/ConfigMap — ever.** `JWT_SECRET`, the DB password (→ `DATABASE_URL`, composed
  at P14), and the chat read-only DB password (`CHAT_READONLY_DB_PASSWORD`) arrive via **ESO → Secrets
  Manager (P12)**. ConfigMaps hold non-secret knobs only (`BASELINE_MODEL_ID`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD`,
  region/model knobs, **`LLM_HOURLY_TOKEN_CAP` — a tuning knob, not a secret**, `API_BASE_URL`).
  `.gitignore` blocks `*-secret.yaml`/`secrets.yaml` as a backstop.
- **`API_BASE_URL` is browser-facing** — it's the **public ingress host** (P15 sslip.io), *not* the
  in-cluster backend Service DNS, because the user's browser (not nginx) calls the backend.
- **In-cluster Postgres uses an EBS-CSI-backed PVC** (no hostPath/container disk) — **P13**.
- **The proactive advisor is a separable subchart** toggled by a `FEATURE_PROACTIVE_ADVISOR` values flag
  (not a code change) — droppable by demo time with no core impact.
- **The CI-agent image is NOT a cluster workload** — it runs in the *user's* Jenkins (BYOK). It is built
  and published by the backend repo's `Jenkinsfile.agent`; it never becomes an umbrella subchart.

## Git / verification

- **Branch → PR (self-review) → merge `--no-ff` → SemVer tag** (per-slice cadence, `v0.X.0`). The
  shell-init commit was the one allowed direct-to-`main`; everything since is feature-branch-only.
- **Verification for chart work = `helm lint charts/modelmatch` + `helm template modelmatch
  charts/modelmatch`** render clean; **no `helm install`**. Conventional Commits, **no Claude co-author
  trailer**, **SSH remote**.
